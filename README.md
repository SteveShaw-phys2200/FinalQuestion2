##Final Question 2

####Aim of the project:
1. derive demensionless differential equations that describe the motion of verticly driven pendulum
1. write program that sovles equations with a/l parameter = 0.01 and initial conditions phi(0) =.99 pi, phidot(0) = 0
1. determine critical value of ommega where pendulum looses stability
1. plot 2 graphs.  one typical stable one typical unstable

* note oscillation about pi (straight up)

![Final 2.1](https://github.com/SteveShaw-phys2200/FinalQuestion2/blob/master/pend-unstable.png)

* note motion is continous circular motion in one direction
